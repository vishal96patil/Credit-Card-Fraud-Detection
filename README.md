# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
To prohibits all fraudulent transactions by fraudsters

The main of this project is start, just before the transaction process completes.
where we use 3 Algorithm 
i) Hidden Markov model (HMM)
ii) Behavior based technique (BBT)
iii) Genetic algorithm 

HMM : This algorithm keep log of the past transaction and user behavior. It analyze pattern of transtion & user behavior, predict diffent possiablety.

BBT : Its analyze the spending habits & pattern of User and categorized into differnt profile. Which generate possiablety on current behavior.

Gentic Algorithm : This alogritm optimizing the seleted threshold values for fraud detection, which take data from HMM and BBT and generate the result on possibilities.
